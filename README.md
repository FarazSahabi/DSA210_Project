# US_Inflation_Effects_Analysis

## Project Synopsis

In this project, I will analyze **how inflation impacts interest rates, consumer spending, investment, GDP (growth domestic product) and overall economy in the US**. The goal is to understand the relationships between these economic factors, identifying patterns and correlations using publicly available economic data. This debated topic could be of great significance and usefulness as understanding these relationships could explain the role of inflation in both economic recessions and expansions. I have chosen the United States as the subject of this project due to its rich availability of economic data, making it an ideal case for thorough and data-driven analysis.

## Objectives

1. **Understand Inflation and Interest Rates**  
   Investigate how inflation influences Federal Reserve decisions on interest rate adjustments. 
   
2. **Examine the Impact of Inflation on Consumer Spending**  
   Assess whether rising inflation leads to a decline in household spending using various systems such as CPI (consumer price index).

3. **Evaluate how Inflation Affects Business Investment**  
   Determine whether inflation discourages businesses from making long-term investments as a response.

4. **Integrate and Take Other Factors in Account**  
   Since economy is very vast and does not just depend on few factors, I will compare the CPI inflation data with other factors such as wages, savings rate, and unemployment rate.

5. **Round Up and Point Out Indirect Effect To GDP**  
   Finally after plotting all the data, understand and analyze the bigger effect inflation will have in the economy, as in towards the GDP, which is biggest indicator of economic performance.

6. **Provide Data-Driven Insights for Economic Trends**  
   Use historical data to track patterns in economic recessions and expansions and use the data science concepts I have learned in DSA210 to analyze and visualize the data.

## Motivation

Inflation, interest rates, and their effects on economic growth and development have long been a topic of debate in economics, particularly between classical and neo-Keynesian economists. By analyzing real-world data, this project aims to uncover the relationships between inflation, interest rates, consumer behavior, and general economic performance by providing valuable insights into both short-term and long-term economic shifts, as well as considering other factors like wages and unemployment.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project consists of publicly available economic indicators that track inflation, interest rates, consumer spending, investment, etc. over time. All data will be taken from the **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)**, a publicly accessible database maintained by the **Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis** which provides accurate, up-to-date U.S. economic time series data. Here’s what I’ll be analyzing:  

- **Date:** The specific month and year for each recorded data point.

- **Recession Periods:** The specific time periods of U.S. recessions that took place that were influential in economic shifts.

- **Inflation (CPI):** Measures the percentage change in consumer prices over time.  
  *(Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics via FRED)*

- **Interest Rates (Federal Funds Rate):** The key interest rate set by the Federal Reserve to manage inflation and stabilize the economy.  
  *(Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US) via FRED )*

- **Consumer Spending (PCE):** Measures the total value of goods and services consumed by households, reflecting behavioral responses to inflation and rate changes.  
  *(Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis via FRED)*

- **Investment (GPDI, Gross private domestic investment):** Tracks how much businesses are spending on long-term capital assets like buildings, equipment, and intellectual property.  
  *(Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis via FRED)*

- **Savings Rate (Personal Savings Rate):** Measures the percentage of disposable income that households save instead of spend, especially during periods of uncertainty.  
  *(Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis via FRED)*

- **Wages (Average Hourly Earnings):** Captures the monthly average wage for private sector employees, used to assess purchasing power under inflation.  
  *(Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis via FRED)*
  
- **Unemployment Rate:** Measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking work; a key indicator of labor market health.  
  *(Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis via FRED)*
  
- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP):** Tracks the total value of goods and services produced in the U.S., serving as a key measure of economic growth and overall economic cycles.
