# The Impact of Inflation on Interest Rates, Consumer Spending, Investment, and the Stock Market in the US

## Project Idea
Inflation is one of the most influential economic factors, affecting both monetary policy and the broader economy. When inflation rises, the Federal Reserve responds by adjusting interest rates to stabilize price levels. These rate changes influence consumer spending, business investment, and financial markets.  

In this project, I will analyze how inflation impacts **interest rates, consumer spending, investment, and stock market performance** in the US. The goal is to understand **the relationships between these factors**, identifying patterns and correlations using publicly available economic data.
