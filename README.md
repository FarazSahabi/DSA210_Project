# US_Inflation_Effects_Analysis

## Project Synopsis

In this project, I will analyze **how inflation impacts interest rates, consumer spending, investment, and stock market performance in the US**. The goal is to understand the relationships between these economic factors, identifying patterns and correlations using publicly available economic data. This debated topic could be of great significance and usefulness as understanding these relationships could explain the role of inflation in both economic recessions and expansions. I have chosen the United States as the subject of this project due to its rich availability of economic data, making it an ideal case for thorough and data-driven analysis.

## Objectives

1. **Understand Inflation and Interest Rates**  
   Investigate how inflation influences Federal Reserve decisions on interest rate adjustments. Identify whether inflation directly correlates with rate hikes and how quickly the
  Federal Reserve reacts.

2. **Examine the Impact of Inflation on Consumer Spending**  
   Assess whether rising inflation leads to a decline in household spending using various systems such as CPI (consumer price index). Identify specific sectors where inflation has the strongest impact on consumption behavior.

3. **Evaluate How Inflation Affects Business Investment**  
   Determine whether inflation discourages businesses from making long-term investments as a response.

4. **Assess the Stock Market's Reaction to Inflation**  
   As a side topic which is slightly dependent on more endogenous factors as compared to the rest, I will identify whether inflation or interest rate changes have a greater effect on stock performance through supply and demand. Therefore, for this data I will consider some more factors.

5. **Provide Data-Driven Insights for Economic Trends**  
   Use historical data to track patterns in economic recessions and expansions and use the data science concepts I have learned in DSA210 to analyze and visualize the data.

## Motivation

Inflation, interest rates, and their effects on economic growth and development have long been a topic of debate in economics, particularly between classical and neo-Keynesian economists. By analyzing real-world data, this project aims to uncover the relationships between inflation, interest rates, consumer behavior, and financial markets—providing valuable insights into both short-term and long-term economic shifts.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project consists of publicly available economic indicators that track inflation, interest rates, consumer spending, investment, and stock market trends over time. Here’s what I’ll be analyzing:  

- **Date:** The specific month and year for each recorded data point.  
- **Inflation (CPI & Core CPI):** Measures the percentage change in consumer prices over time. *(Source: [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/))*  
- **Interest Rates (Federal Funds Rate):** The key rate set by the Federal Reserve to control inflation. *(Source: [Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/))*  
- **Consumer Spending (PCE & Retail Sales):** Tracks how much households spend on goods and services. *(Source: [Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/))*  
- **Investment (Private Fixed Investment & Business Loans):** Measures business spending on capital investments and borrowing trends. *(Source: [FRED / BEA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/))*  
- **Stock Market Performance (S&P 500, NASDAQ, Dow Jones):** Examines how inflation and interest rate changes affect stock prices. *(Source: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/))*  

I will collect, clean, and store this data systematically in an **Excel file and Jupyter Notebook** to ensure consistency and accuracy. **Any external economic shocks (e.g., financial crises, pandemics) will be considered as potential outliers and flagged for review.**
