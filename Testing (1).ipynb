CPI vs Consumer Spending (PCE):**  \n"," -- We tested whether inflation is correlated with consumer spending. A Pearson correlation showed a strong positive relationship (r = 0.98, p < 0.001), indicating that as inflation increases, nominal consumer spending also rises.\n","\n","**2. CPI vs Wages:**  \n","-- We calculated overall growth rates and found that CPI grew significantly more than wages during the period. A paired t-test on monthly % changes showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05), meaning inflation has risen faster than wage growth on average.\n","\n","**3. CPI vs Investment (GPDI):**  \n","-- A Pearson correlation was used to assess whether investment increases alongside inflation. The result showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.95, p < 0.001), suggesting that business investment tends to rise during inflationary periods.\n","\n","**4. CPI vs Unemployment Rate:**  \n","-- A negative correlation was expected. The results confirmed this with a significant inverse relationship (r = -0.74, p < 0.001), supporting the economic principle that inflation tends to rise when unemployment falls.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"u7gDGM7zqCDg"}}]}
